# Fitness Meetup!

## Description
A health and fitness application where users can sign up and log in to socialize and post with other gym goers. Users can post their workout, what was worked out, and time of day they worked out. Users can also post and see other users posts when it comes to diet and health conscious meals.

Created to have a space for gyn beginners and gym rats to come together and share workouts, motivation, and meal plans!
